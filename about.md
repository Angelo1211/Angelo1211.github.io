Hello there! I'm √Ångel Ortiz and I'm a Graphics Programmer at Rockstar North <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/careers/offices/rockstar-north
" target="blank">(We're hiring!)</a>. Ever since I joined R* in 2019 I've been incredibly fortunate to help ship some awesome projects like Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC/Stadia and the Casino DLC for GTA V.
<p/>


<p>
Currently, my personal Graphics and Programming interests lie in doing loads of low-level programming, reading about  efficient rendering algorithms that are even cooler than <a href="http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html" target="blank">Clustered Shading</a>, trying to capture beautiful sunsets through Sky and Atmospheric rendering, building solid Graphics fundamentals with Path Tracing and, finally, having loads of fun with Signed Distance Fields and Raymarching.
<p/>

<p>
Before joining R* I worked on two major graphics projects on my own. The first was <a href="https://github.com/Angelo1211/SoftwareRenderer" target="blank">SSGE</a>, a CPU based software renderer written entirely in C++ with no external libraries and capable of running PBR-like shaders. The second one was <a href="https://github.com/Angelo1211/HybridRenderingEngine" target="blank"> HRE</a>, a GPU based renderer written in OpenGL where I learned about PBR, IBL and also fancy compute based Clustered Shading algorithms for lightning fast light culling.
</p>

<p>
In another lifetime I graduated from <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="blank">Virginia Tech</a> with a degree in <a href="https://www.aoe.vt.edu/" target="blank">Aerospace Engineering</a> whose biggest use nowadays is as a conversation starter. However, my passion for space and spacecraft remains as strong as ever (I'm dying to see a rocket launch live!) but it's now been merged neatly into a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wtVSzm" target="blank">totally</a> healthy <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tslczN" target="blank"> obsession</a> with <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wtcXWX" target="blank"> space</a> scenery and<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WsSSDV" target="blank"> images</a> in
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lKBzc" target="blank"> shadertoy.</a>
One of my proudest achievements still is that time NASA gave my Senior Design Team's project a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/university-students-compete-in-yearlong-nasa-human-space-exploration-competition" target="blank">shout-out on their website.</a>
