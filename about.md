Hi! I'm √Ångel Ortiz an aspiring graphics programmer currently living in Barcelona, Spain. I graduated from <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="blank">Virginia Tech</a> in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.aoe.vt.edu/" target="blank">Aerospace Engineering.</a>
<p/>

<p>
In the past year I've shifted my main interest to mastering C++ and Graphics Programming in a quest to multiclass into the ultimate Graphics Programmer/Aerospace Engineer that nobody knew they needed in their party/company. I've since completed two major many months-long projects where I did my best to showcase what I've learned so far. The first is <a href="https://github.com/Angelo1211/SoftwareRenderer" target="blank">SSGE</a> a CPU based software renderer written entirely in C++ with no external libraries and capable of running PBR shaders. The second one is <a href="https://github.com/Angelo1211/HybridRenderingEngine" target="blank"> HRE </a> a GPU based renderer written in OpenGL that has PBR, IBL and also a fancy compute based Clustered Shading algorithm for lightning fast light culling.
</p>
Unsurprisingly, I'm also really into space, and I've worked on some very cool space related projects in the past. My proudest achievement is, without a doubt, that NASA gave my senior design team's project a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/university-students-compete-in-yearlong-nasa-human-space-exploration-competition" target="blank">shout-out last year.</a> I've also done some neat Machine Learning stuff with <a href="https://github.com/Angelo1211/Statoil-Project" target="blank">satellite imaging and Keras. </a>

<p/>
<p/>
Otherwise, when I'm not programming I spend most of my own time reading about space, playing EU4, enjoying the local food in BCN and very occasionally taking photographs.
