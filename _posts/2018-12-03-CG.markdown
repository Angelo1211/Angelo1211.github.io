###  Tweet sized TL;DR:
---

<br>
*Cluster shading is an efficient and versatile rendering algorithm capable of unified lighting for both forward and deferred shading systems. It divides the view frustum into a 3D grid of blocks or "clusters" and quickly computes a list of lights intersecting each active volume.*
