description: Blog about building a new place to showcase my work & personal projects.
---

Hello! Welcome to my personal website and portfolio page. I have built it with the goal of serving both as a place to store my current thoughts and ramblings and as a hub to showcase my work and personal projects in a more neat and organized fashion.
<br/>

This being my first foray into web dev and front end stuff I apologize in advance for the sparse look and feel of the page. I'm figuring things out as I go and I'm treating this as another work-in-progress project to learn more about the intricacies of  web development. 
<br/>

Nevertheless, I have some of my most recent work already on display on my portfolio tab and more is on the way! I'll leave this here as a sneak peek of a project I've been working on for a while and will be talking more about soon:
