*** TODO Intro
**** Is the warning really necessary?
**** Core concepts [10/10] [100%]
     - [X] We want to discuss some specific important concepts in the topic of efficient shading
     - [X] Efficient rendering is needed to render nearly anything these days
     - [X] Impossible to get modern graphics without some form of it
     - [X] Specify what portion of the rendering pipeline we are trying to improve upon
     - [X] Explain there are other methods that also improve performance but assume we don't care about it
     - [X] We will be focusing on pixel shader evaluations to be exact
     - [X] Strip away unimportant details
     - [X] No free lunch and overhead
     - [X] Future performance trends and what kinds of algorithms we'll in the future
     - [X] Ending
